# 2021 Capital Bike share data Analysis and Visualizations
### by Stimson

## Dataset

 Capital Bikeshare, provides the **trips data around Washington DC Metro Area** from the year 2010. Each quarter, we publish [downloadable files](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html) of Capital Bikeshare trip data. For the analysis we explore on 2021 data. The data includes:

+ Duration – Duration of trip
+ Start Date – Includes start date and time
+ End Date – Includes end date and time
+ Start Station – Includes starting station name and number
+ End Station – Includes ending station name and number
+ Bike Number – Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
+ Member Type – Indicates whether user was a "registered" member (Annual Member, 30-Day Member or Day Key Member) or a "casual" rider (Single Trip, 24-Hour Pass, 3-Day Pass or 5-Day Pass)
This data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, trips that are taken to/from any of our “test” stations at our warehouses and any trips lasting less than 60 seconds (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).

*NOTE: The 3-Day Membership replaced the 5-Day Membership in Fall 2011*

## Summary of Findings
